spill_detection
- detect spills by tracking for temperature and OD anomalies
  - either only temperature, only OD or combination, or both
  - temperature is a constant parameter (unlike OD)
- what detection method?
  - peak detection via signal processing
  - moving z-score
  - calculating large rate of changes (derivatives)

pause_stop
- user should pause be able to pause or stop eVOLVER during experiment
- pause state
  - stop all pumps
  - cease recording data
  - notify user in data logs times where pauses were initiated and when experiment resumed
  - disconnect from socketIO
- stop state
  - close pyShell to terminate process
  - kill process (if pyShell doesnt already)
- app close
  - treat as stop state --> not ideal because user should directly determine if an experiment is ended
    - stop/kill experiment
  - keep process running *
- handle potential running experiments when app closes & reopens --> might be possible but difficult to implement due to different mechanisms related to communicating with processes across platforms
  - reconnect application with running process via pipe or other mechanism 

- export data files
  - file selection
    - send all output files
    - send only raw and transformed data files
    - give user ability to select individual files
  - file exportation mechanism
    - via email
      - need to get user email address; can include in custom_script and input from UI
      - take into consideration file sizes??
      - look into packages that includes built in tools
